Perspective: White Rioters on the ground
	Today we will avenge one of our sisters from the assault of a vicious and uncouth black man. How dare they lay their hands on one of us! For years they’ve overstepped their bounds and even begun to look down on us white folks, today is the day we show them their place. Thousands have gathered here at the courthouse to prepare for the lynching, but the sheriff refuses to hand over the nigger, damn him for protecting the nigger - we all know he needs a good lynching. The black filth must learn where they belong, but we won’t harm one of our own.
	Damn those niggers to hell! A posse stormed the courthouse and fired on us! Tonight is their reckoning, my brothers and I will burn their town to the ground, tear down their “Wall Street,” and make them understand how powerless they are when they face the pure race. I shall return home to grab my guns, then may God help any nigger I come across. 
	Now perhaps the blacks will repent for their sins, fires burn through Greenwood, and no fireman will ‘save’ them on my watch! The army is here and rains down divine judgement against the niggers. Due justice shall be wrought upon those who have sinned and their brothers, and may that teach them to attack one of our own again. Now that the fires are in full force, it is time to venture deeper and reclaim what was stolen from us whites. No black man should live beyond the means even the basest whites, and I myself will enforce this. Greenwood was built upon decades of sin and corruption, and we shall reclaim and purify it tonight.
	The National Guard has come and put our movement to a stop, but our purpose has been accomplished. Judgement has been wrought, and we have been avenged. Greenwood lies in ruins and may the niggers pause before they think about sinning against us again!
