API – Application Programming Interface
Diamond Syntax: Specifying the parameter only once and leaving a ‘<>’ diamond for the compiler to figure out for itself.
Collection: Object that groups multiple elements into one unit [ArrayList]

Autoboxing / Unboxing – Automatics ‘boxes’ primitives into objects when necessary (ArrayLists)
