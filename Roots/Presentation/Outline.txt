- Golden dream of democracy, hundreds of thousands of donations
- 20 donors, 500 million dollars, 25 million people

Elites vs General Public
- When politicians can turn to these special interests for money, why spend time rallying constituency for money/support
- no longer who people support more, who lobbying giants like more
- A study … demonstrates that the influence gen. public has in politics marginalized when compared to influence elite have
- support on policy, little influence on legislation
- tobacco, extensive money and marketing to suppress and delay

Anger and democracy
- Subversive to the idea of a democracy
- Founded on the idea people have a right to representation
- Fought at every turn to ensure people are properly represented
o 15th 19th amendments
o Unions
o Fought in countless wars around the world in the name of demoracy

What can we do?
- Most important is to raise awareness on the issue
- Issue of campaign finance has come a long way since gilded ages and political machines
- Legislation before congress, petition/ write letters, stay informed/spread awareness
- Not an oligarchy: stay informed and show desire to fix system
- General awareness and anger over … Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002
- Join growing movement against political corruption and special interest in politics
