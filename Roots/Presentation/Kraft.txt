But when he started his journey as a merchant, he was not so different from you all. Much like yourself, Mr. Lawrence is a man of humble origins. Born the son of a farmer, he began as a simple traveling merchant with nothing but a few coins to accompany his wit. Originally from the South, he worked up way up from an apprentice selling wheat to his current position as the senior economic advisor to the king. Through countless trails of hardship and diligence, Mr. Lawrence has become a successful merchant who has competed against and has connections with famous organizations such as the Ruvik Alliance and the Diva Company that support our country today, and he even boasts connects to the Holy Church. Among his notable achievements, Mr. Lawrence has helped resolve the currency crisis of the Winfield Kingdom and participated in the infamous Narwhale trade war in Lenos, helping the Milone Company secure the rights to the town. Today, you will have the opportunity to listen to and learn from this esteemed merchant, so please welcome Mister Kraft Lawrence.
